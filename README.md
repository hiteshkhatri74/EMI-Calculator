The EMI Calculator is a web application built using React. It allows users to calculate their Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) for loans by entering the loan amount, interest rate, and loan tenure. The app dynamically updates the EMI amount as users adjust the inputs, providing an intuitive and interactive experience. React's state management and component-based architecture make it easy to handle user inputs and display the results in real-time, ensuring a smooth and responsive interface.
